    <p>Plankton is the nemesis and the former best friend of Mr. Krabs. 
        He operates the Chum Bucket, located directly across the street 
        from Krabs' restaurant, the Krusty Krab.[6] The Chum Bucket primarily 
        sells chum (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly 
        inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. 
        Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a monopoly 
        on the fast food industry. His villainous efforts to do this are widely known within the show; 
        fellow character Squidward Tentacles refers to Plankton as "the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom".</p>
